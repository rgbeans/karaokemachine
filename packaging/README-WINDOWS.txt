KaraokeMachine — Windows build
===============================

QUICK START
1. Extract the whole "KaraokeMachine" folder somewhere. Do not run the exe
   from inside the zip.
2. Double-click karaokemachine.exe.
3. Windows may show a SmartScreen warning because this is an unsigned
   preview build. Click "More info" -> "Run anyway".
4. Allow microphone access if Windows asks. If it does not ask, enable:
   Settings -> Privacy & security -> Microphone -> Let desktop apps access
   your microphone.

IMPORTANT: NO COMMERCIAL AUDIO IS BUNDLED
- Keep the "assets" folder next to karaokemachine.exe.
- This portable build ships only the app and the generated warm-up tracks.
  It does not contain commercial recordings.
- Use Library -> Maps to browse the public map list, then use Import Map File
  for a downloaded package. The app downloads the audio from the map's source
  link and applies the mapping locally.
- The six generated warm-ups ship with a finished level file and are playable.
- Every imported song starts with no level file. Click it in the library and
  choose a map file in the editor, or create a new one. The old automatic
  chart is shown translucently as a guide only; it is not playable until you
  draw the notes and place every lyric word yourself.
- Press SUBMIT MAPPING only when the editor says the mapping is complete.
  After that the map file becomes a finished level and the song is playable.
- Drafts and finished levels are separate JSON files in the song's
  "maps" folder. Drafts are playable previews. If a song has multiple map
  files, choose one from the map dropdown before pressing PLAY.

MAPS AND AUDIO
- A map package contains notes, lyrics, cover art, and the original source
  link. It never contains audio.
- Library -> Maps -> Import Map File installs a downloaded JSON map as a
  separate level file. If the audio is not local, the app fetches it from the
  source link and separates it.
- Maps marked NO AUDIO are chart-only silent scores. They have no source link,
  download nothing, and play on the chart clock.
- Uploading a brand new song, or installing a map whose audio is not already
  local, also needs Node.js 22+, ffmpeg, yt-dlp, and Python 3 with Demucs and
  numpy. They are not bundled with this portable build; the import scripts
  that drive them are (the dist-tools and tools folders).
- If those tools are installed on PATH, paste a YouTube, Spotify or
  SoundCloud link in Library -> Imports -> Upload Song. KaraokeMachine will
  fetch editable metadata and lyrics, download the audio, separate the
  backing and vocal stems, and open the editor automatically.
- If the tools are missing, the upload and map-install flows explain what to
  install. The bundled warm-ups do not need them.

OTHER CONTROLS
- Settings has an input-microphone picker, a Play backing track checkbox and a
  vocal level. BACKING ON/OFF and VOCALS ON/OFF are also in the bottom tray.
- Settings -> Test range records your comfortable low and high notes. Save it,
  then use "Fit current song to my range" to apply the best octave shift to the
  chart.
- Singing the right note in a different octave is accepted as a hit and keeps
  the combo, but it shows "OCTAVE" and does not count as perfect.
